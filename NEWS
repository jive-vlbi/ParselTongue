*** Changes in ParselTongue 1.0.1

* Bug fixes

ParselTongue will now deal gracefully with missing readline support in
Python.  The AIPSUVData.antennas, AIPSUVData.polarizations and
AIPSUVData.sources attributes no longer incorrectly cache their
results.

Obit no longer leaks huge amounts of memory, can now access FG tables
and now produces CL tables that no longer confuse AIPS.

* New functionality

Dictonary-like access to table rows is now possible, and

>>> uvdata = AIPSUVData('MULTI', 'UVDATA', 1, 1)
>>> print len(uvdata)

prints the number of visibilities in the data set.

*** Changes in ParselTongue 1.0

* Renaming data sets

It is now possible to rename images and UV data:

>>> uvdata = AIPSUVData('MULTI', 'UVDATA', 1, 1)
>>> uvdata.rename('N05C2', 'UVDATA', 1, 1)

* History access

You can now access the history table of a data set:

>>> print uvdata.history[6]

will print the 7th record in the history.

* Changing keywords

It is now possible to change non-standard keywords:

>>> uvdata.keywords['OLDFRQ'] = 1.64249000e9

will set the keyword 'OLDFRQ' to 1.6 GHz.  This also works for tables,
but make sure you close the table explicitly when you're done with it,
otherwise you'll lose the change:

>>> antable.keywords['ARRNAM'] = 'EVN'
>>> antable.close()


*** Changes in ParselTongue 0.99

* Support for the AIPS TV

It is now possible to run AIPS tasks that use the AIPS TV, provided
the AIPS TV is running on the local machine and it is set up to use
internet sockets for communication with AIPS tasks.  A TVServer script
to start the AIPS TV server is provided.  Some limited support to
control the TV from ParselTongue is also included:

>>> tv = AIPSTV()
>>> tv.start()

will start the AIPS TV from ParselTongue

>>> tv.clear()

will clear the AIPS TV ("TVINIT").

>>> tv.kill()

will close down the AIPS TV in a somewhat gracefull way.

* Support for more AIPS disks

ParselTongue now supports up to 35 AIPS disks.


*** Changes in ParselTongue 0.97

* Interface changes

AIPSUVData.header, AIPSImage.header, AIPSUVData.tables and
AIPSImage.tables are now properties of the data set.  The header
property has its own attributes.  The names of these attributes match
the names used by AIPS' GETHEAD and PUTHEAD verbs.  So instead of:

>>> print AIPSImage.header()['OBSDAT']
>>> print AIPSUVData.tables()

you now should use:

>>> print AIPSImage.header.date_obs
>>> print AIPSUVData.tables


AIPSTable.header should no longer be used since a much better syntax
now exists to deal with tables.  So instead of:

    sutable = uvdata.table('AIPS SU', 0)
    suheader = sutable.header()
    nrow = suheader['nrow']
    for rowno in xrange(1, nrow + 1):
        row = sutable.getrow(rowno)
        print row['SOURCE'][0].strip()

you now should use:

    sutable = uvdata.table('SU', 0)
    for row in sutable:
        print row.source.strip()


This should make the ParselTongue interface much more consistent.
